    "You are welcome to be creative and come up with your own code for solving these problems. In particular, the SciPy (Scientific Python) library has a number of useful functions for handling differential equations. But make sure that you are using the correct algorithm. (In particular, if the question says to use Euler's method, make sure that's what you're using. Most numerical algorithms that are used in practice are more sophisticated."
